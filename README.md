🏗️ AI-Based Construction Cost Estimation System

An end-to-end AI-powered system that automates construction cost estimation — from blueprint generation to real-time material price scraping and intelligent cost computation.

🚀 Overview

This project eliminates manual construction cost estimation by integrating:

🏠 AI-driven 2D blueprint generation (SVG)

🧱 Automated material quantity extraction

🌐 Real-time price scraping using Selenium

⚡ Redis-based caching for optimized performance

📊 Intelligent cost computation with labor & contingency factors

The system provides fast, transparent, and data-driven cost estimates based on live market pricing.

🔄 System Workflow

User Input (Plot Details)
→ Generate 2D SVG Blueprint
→ Extract Materials (Cement, Steel, Sand, Bricks, Aggregates)
→ Scrape Live Prices (IndiaMART + Local Suppliers)
→ Redis Cache (24-hour caching)
→ Cost Calculation (Material + 30% Labor + 12% Contingency)
→ Return Final Cost Estimate
